description: Settle in for a rollicking science-fiction adventure from golden-era
  star Murray Leinster. In The Fifth-Dimension Tube, a prominent scientist and his
  beloved daughter have become stranded in another dimension. In order to survive,
  they must cast their lot with rogue mathematician Tommy Reeves. To succeed in this
  life-or-death endeavor, Reeves has to overcome not only his own gadabout ways, but
  also the thugs who are pursuing him.
